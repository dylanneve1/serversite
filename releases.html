<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="whats-new">What’s new</h3>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the user may be signed out of their Apple ID</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue that caused MobileSubstrate initialization to be delayed</li>
  <li>Detect a case where the user may have an OTA update downloaded, which caused issues for some users</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The following issues are caused by incorrect DFU mode entry, please make sure to follow the instructions in the UI:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An issue where the taptic engine did not work on some devices</li>
  <li>An issue where biometrics did not work for some users</li>
  <li>An issue where the touch screen became unresponsive for some users</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Battery settings panel issue:</strong> We have investigated this issue extensively and found that some tweaks and libraries which some tweaks depend on cause this issue.</p>

<h4 id="other-changes">Other changes</h4>

<p>This update includes a new fast DFU sequence. Entering DFU mode should now be safer and more reliable.</p>

<p>The loading mechanism for substrate has improved in this update, which improves the stability of the device.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing the -20, please rejailbreak with the the no-substrate mode option checked in the app, and see if removing tweaks resolves your issue.</p>

<h3 id="unsupported-devices">Unsupported devices</h3>

<p>checkra1n will eventually support all devices between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone X, however, this beta lacks support for the following devices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iPad Air 2</li>
  <li>iPad 5th Gen</li>
  <li>iPad Pro 1st Gen</li>
</ul>

<p>Support for these devices will be added in a later release.</p>

<p>Support for the following devices is experimental, and may require more attempts than usual:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iPhone 5s</li>
  <li>iPad Mini 2</li>
  <li>iPad Mini 3</li>
  <li>iPad Air</li>
</ul>

<p>Reliability on these devices will be improved in future releases.</p>

<h3 id="unsupported-platforms">Unsupported platforms</h3>

<p>This beta is only available for macOS. Work is ongoing to support Windows and Linux, which will be added in a later release.</p>

<h3 id="package-managers">Package managers</h3>

<p>At the moment, checkra1n only supports installing Cydia. Support for other package managers is coming soon, and will not require a checkra1n update.</p>
